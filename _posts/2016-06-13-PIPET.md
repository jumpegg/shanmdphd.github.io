From Physiology to Pharmacokinetics
KSCPT 2016 - Workshop

{frontmatter}

# Introduction
## 2:00~2:10 Course Introduction
임동석 교수님(PIPET, Catholic)께서 workshop에 대해 소개해 주셨습니다.
> 외국의 1주일 workshop을 다녀오면 3-4주간 digestion해야 자신의 지식으로 만들수 있습니다.

# Day 1: Physiologic basis for mAb/protein pharmacokinetics

- Lecturer: 한승훈 교수님 PIPET, Catholic
- 6월 13일 부산벡스코 제1전시장 회의실 214호

## 2:10~3:00 mAb/Therapeutic Protein, what are they?
- What is biologics?
  - Contrary to chemicals (xenobiotics 생체내에 존재하지 않는 물질.)
  - "Intrinsic molecules of biologic system" - sugars, proteins or nucleic acids
  - includes monoclonal Ab, Vaccine, protein drugs
  - Various sources
- Hard to manufacture (peptide chains)
  - complex structure
  - asceptic principles

> "Biological products often represent the cutting edge of biomedical research."

| Bioequivalence | Biosimilar |
|---|---|
| chemical | antibody etc |

- Therapeutic proteins
  - Definition : otherwise be absent(wiki) - this is actually not right. Too narrow.
  - Group 1 -
    - 1a replacing a protein that is deficient or abnormal (Insulin, GF)
    - 1b augmenting an existing pathway (EPO, G-CSF, GM-CSF) : modification (PEGylation)
    - 1c providing a novel function or activity (botox, hyaluronidase)
  - Group 2 - ptn therapeutics with special targeting activity (**Today's focus**)
    - 2b Delivering other compounds or proteins - Targeting (Ontak, Zevalin, Mylotarg)
  - Group 3 - ptn vaccines
  - Group 4 - ptn diagnostics

> This shows a number of examples. (Group 1-4)
> Very nice review paper regarding protein therapeutics

- Biologics (includes) Therapeutic proteins (includes) mAb
- What is mAb?
  - produced by plasma cells
  - Examples of 2a (Leader 2008)
  - Humira
  - Paratope (a lock) + Epitope (a key) = binding promoting immune response. Fc region
- Isotype
  - IgG 1,2,3,4 - the most important
- IgG
  - 70-85%, 150kDa (Huge), the longest t<sub>1/2</sub>
  - variable region - paratope
  - Comparison of IgG subtypes
  - trifunctional Ab*** T cell binding (Most important) - inhibiting T cell escape
- Monoclonal
  - Monoclonal vs Polyclonal (Example. HBV Ig)
- Nomenclature
  - Humira - Adalimumab (mu - Murine Ab, li - immune )
  - Bevacizumab ci - circulatory, zu - human
- Humanization
  - Mouse - Chimeric - Humanized - Human
  - Freq of administration(high->low)
  - Repeated admin(difficult->possible)
  - Effector function | CDC,ADCC(low->high)

## 3:10~4:00 Incorporation of physiology to the PK of mAb/Therapeutic Protein
- What is PK? ADME
- Exposure - Response relationship
  - This is especially important.
- Guidance - Europe - PK evaluation of protein therapeutics
- chronotrophic - diurnal variation
  - We never know individual diurnal conc of protein but we don't need to know it either. Becuase we're only focusing on **population**
- Absorption
  - SC adm -> lymphatic system
  - recovery in lymph is correlated to MW.
- Disposition
  - Central to peripheral
  - Distribution (inside the body) vs Elimination (outside the body or change to another substance)
  - 각부분에선 degradation이 안되고, specific tissue에서 degradation vs "Protein은 몸 어디에서든 degradation 될 수 있습니다."

> There is an inverse corr b/w ss Vss and MW. A comparable relationship is seen also for permeability and MW.

|char|small molecules|mAb|
|-|-|-|
|route of adm|all|parenteral|
|V|wide range|40-70mL/kg ~ **Plasma volume**|
|Elimination|CYP,UGT|Non-specific-normal catabolism, specific-TMDD|

- key structure for determining distribution
endothelial cells
- Cross capillary wall
- Fenestrated capillary - endothelial walls
- pore size
  - <1nm
- Starling equation

{$$}
JV \propto (P_c - P_i) - (\pi_{pp}-\pi_{ip})
{/$$}

- Prediction of human CL from nonclinical Data
- Catabolic pathway
  1. allometric approach : Renal CL
  2. IVIVE - in vitro -> in vivo prediction
- Prediction of CL : allometric approach
  - Filtration
  - Anion < neutral < Cation
  - CL {$$}\propto{/$$} GFR
- Blood CL
- FcRn recycling - allowing long half-life (Mitragotri, 2014, Nat Dev Drug Discovery)
  - Monocyte or endothelial cells
  - PH가 중요하다. Kd가 작을수록 더 잘 붙는다. 더 잘 보호된다. 따라서 t1/2가 높아짐.
  - FcRn이 일어나는 것과 안일어나는 것 - Fc가 있는가 없는가에 따라서.
- 모두 occupy 되어 있으면 maximal elimination - Zero order를 따라서 제거됨.



## 4:10~5:00 Implementations in PK models for mAb/Therapeutic Protein



## Questions

1. Individual - Diurnal variation - Insulin? Plasma Glucose biomarker - 결국 Precision medicine에서 biomarker를 쉽게 측정할 수 있다면..? Group 1a?
2. Route of adm - all vs parenteral(IV,IM,SC)
임형석 교수님-먹는 Ab의 개발 가능성
