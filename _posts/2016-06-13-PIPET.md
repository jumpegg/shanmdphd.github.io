## 2:10~3:00 mAb/Therapeutic Protein, what are they?
- What is biologics?
  - Contrary to chemicals (xenobiotics 생체내에 존재하지 않는 물질.)
  - "Intrinsic molecules of biologic system" - sugars, proteins or nucleic acids
  - includes monoclonal Ab, Vaccine, protein drugs
  - Various sources
- Hard to manufacture (peptide chains)
  - complex structure
  - using biologics
  - asceptic principles

> "Biological products often represent the cutting edge of biomedical research."

| Bioequivalence | Biosimilar |

| chemical | antibody etc |

- Therapeutic proteins
  - Definition : otherwise be absent(wiki) - this is actually not right. Too narrow.
  - Group 1 -
    - 1a replacing a protein that is deficient or abnormal (Insulin, GF)
    - 1b augmenting an existing pathway (EPO, G-CSF, GM-CSF) : modification (PEGylation)
    - 1c providing a novel function or activity (botox, hyaluronidase)
  - Group 2 - ptn therapeutics with special targeting activity (**Today's focus**)
    - 2b Delivering other compounds or proteins - Targeting (Ontak, Zevalin, Mylotarg)
  - Group 3 - ptn vaccines
  - Group 4 - ptn diagnostics

> Leader B et al. Protein therapeutics. Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2008.
> This shows large amounts of examples. (Group 1-4)

- Biologics (includes) Therapeutic proteins (includes) mAb
- What is mAb?
  - produced by plasma cells
  - Examples of 2a (Leader 2008)
  - Humira
  - Paratope (a lock) + Epitope (a key) = binding promoting immune response. Fc region
- Isotype
  - IgG 1,2,3,4 - the most important
- IgG
  - 70-85%, 150kDa (Huge), the longest t<sub>1/2</sub>
  - variable region - paratope
  - Comparison of IgG subtypes
  - trifunctional Ab*** T cell binding (Most important) - inhibiting T cell escape
- Monoclonal
  - Monoclonal vs Polyclonal (Example. HBV Ig)
- Nomenclature
  - Humira - Adalimumab (mu - Murine Ab, li - immune )
  - Bevacizumab ci - circulatory, zu - human
- Humanization
  - Mouse - Chimeric - Humanized - Human
  - Freq of administration(high->low)
  - Repeated admin(difficult->possible)
  - Effector function|CDC,ADCC(low->high)

## 3:10~4:00 Incorporation of physiology to the PK of mAb/Therapeutic Protein

## 4:10~5:00 Implementations in PK models for mAb/Therapeutic Protein
