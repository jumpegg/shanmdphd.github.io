## Session 2 Global regulatory experiences in orphan drug development

### Considerations for drug development for rare diseases : Cases of inborn errors of metabolism
- Speaker: In Sook Kim, Ph.D. FDA Office of Clinical Pharmacology
- Beginning with the goal in mind
- 45 NME/New BLA in 2015
- Novel Drug Approval for rare diseases 2010-2015, 77 novel drugs for rare (37 cancer, 10 inborn e of metabolism)
- Rare disease (Orphan disease) - less than 200k
- ~500 rare disease have approved drugs. / ~7000 rare disease
- Goals: safe and efficacious drug
- uncertainty를 줄이고, evidence of efficacy and safety
- Challenging: Limited clinical experiences, Lakc of understanding of natural history of the disease - limited opportunities for learning
- Ivacaftor: CFTR protein - for G551D(Defective CFTR protein), hard to apply

  - [Phase II Trial](http://investors.vrtx.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=902790)
  - Phase 2 Trial - 39 patients
  - PD parameters: sweat Cl, Nose potential difference, Lung function: FEV1
  - [NEJM](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1409547)
- Eliglustat ([Cerdelga^&reg;^](http://www.cerdelga.com/))
  - glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor indicated for the long-term treatment of adult patients with Gaucher disease type 1 who are CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs), intermediate metabolizers (IMs), or poor metabolizers (PMs) as detected by an FDA-cleared test
  - Metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4
  - Simulation and Modeling
  - EM, systemic exposure at SS is 7-9 fold higher in poor metabolizer
  - PBPK analysis - CYP2D6, CYP3A4 inhibitor 동시에 넣었을때 24배 증가 prediction
  - Contraindication!
  - Risk management에서 중요함!
- Sebelipase alfa ([Kanuma^&reg;^](http://www.kanuma.com/))
  - 2 Pivotal studies (Infantile-onset(Wolman ds), Late-onset(Cholesteryl ester storage ds))
  - FDA-APPROVED TREATMENT FOR LYSOSOMAL ACID LIPASE DEFICIENCY (LAL-D)
  - Webpage ^[http://news.alexionpharma.com/press-release/product-news/fda-approves-kanuma-sebelipase-alfa-treatment-patients-lysosomal-acid-lip]
- Opportunities for innovation

### Role of pharmacometrics in the development of orphan drugs
- Speaker: Jee Eun Lee, Ph.D. FDA
- Orphan drug Act
- NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)

- Orphan vs non-orphan (# of CT 2.8 vs 3.5)
- Pharmacometric analysis in 26% and 84% were pivotal for approval and labeling decisions, respectively.
- Oncology에서는 body weight. drug & surface의 관계가 있다.
- Adalimumab in pediatric CD
  - CDAI vs PCDAI
  - J.Lee Digestive Disease Week, 2016
  - Role of Quantitative Clinical Pharmacology in Pediatric Approval and Labeling `r citep("10.1124/dmd.116.069559")` ^[http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/44/7/924.long]

## Session 4 Asan initia tives for rare disease
### Leverage big data to better understand rare disease states and patient needs (rare disease registry & research experience)
- Speaker: Kyu-pyo Kim, M.D., Ph.D. Asan Medical Center
