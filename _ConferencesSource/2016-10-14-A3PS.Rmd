### Integrative PKPD modling and simulation of Amenamevir for treatment of recurrent genital herpes
- Akitsuga Takada
- HSV-1, HSV-2(Genital)
- PKPD analysis

### Model Based Meta-Analysis to quantify and compare the efficacy of non-hormonal drugs on menopausal Hot flashes
- Lujin Li (PCPC)
- Hot flashes - low levels of estrogen
- SSRI, SNRI, Gabapentin, clonidine
- Tx : HRT, Non-hormonal drugs - regulators of central neurotransmitters, phytoestrogens
- Lancet 2008 - limitation : speed of onset
- MBMA - useful (Model based meta analysis)
- Pubmed, cochrane library
- hot flash, 
- Emax model
15,5,4,~ (39 studies)
    - The effects
- soy isoflavones
- Placebo
- run-in design is better.

### Dosing optimization in obesity using pharmacometrics approach: population PK and PD of meropenem in non-obese, obese and mobidly obese patients
- Eun Kyung Chung (PAGK)
- PK model development
- Stepwise model development
- Covariate model building
- Model selection criteria : goodness of fit plots, RSE, OFV
- Structural CMT PK model
- observed conc - individual predicted concentration
- Visual predictive checks - quite good
- MIC - probability of target attainment
- PD analysis - CrCl<50

Application Session
-------------

### The application of pharmacometrics in individual therapy in China
- speaker: Zheng Jiao (PCPC)
- [Java PK for dashtop](http://pkpd.kmu.edu.tw/jpkd/)
- Bayesian Dose Estimation
- Drugs - Immunosuppressant, vanco, anti-epil
- Non adhereence in chronic disease
- individualized therapeutic range
- many dashboard systems in China

### PD model fo Bayesian Prediction of myelosuppression rpofiles based on routine clinical data after gemcitabine and carboplatin treatment
- speaker: Yoshitaka Yano (PAGJa)
- GEM, CDDP - PLT, RBC, WBC
- NM7.3 FOCE
- Bootstrap resampling / estimation
- Correlation plots of IPRED vs DV
- VPC - 90% predictive interval

### Modeling and validating chronic pharmacological manupulation of circadian rhythms
- speaker: Jaekyung Kim(PAGK)
- Transcriptional negative clock
- Entrain.org

- 180 variables
- Okazaki (2014), Symptom differs (2010)

### Application of PK/PD modeling and simulation in antiviral drug development
- speaker: Kun Wang (PCPC)
- varal dynamic model 
- HIV replication cycle 
- Target - Virus - Infected cell
- T (CD4) I (Infected CD4) 
- Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/RTV) 
- influenza - oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate

### pharmacometrics in clinical practice: pop PK analysis of febuxostat in patients with severe renal impairment
- speaker: Daiki Hira
- Febuxostat - renal execretion + biliary
- Allopurinol -> Oxypurinol - renal execretion

Regulation
-------------

### Japan
- speaker: Yusuke Tanigawara (PAGJa)
- Structural, Error, Covariate model
- Model diagnosis - 각 스텝마다 해야 된다.
- Model qualification(or evaluation / validation)이 중요하다. Final stage -> Bootstrap, External validation, VPC

### Korea
- speaker: Howard Lee (PAGK)
- 의약품 개발 시 집단 약동학 활용
- Dose optimization and ethnic bridging
- Technical pharmacometrics trap
- Impact 
- Technical modelling

### EMA regulations on meling issues
- speaker: Jaewoo Kim (PAGK)
- Guidance for industry

### Recent examples of impact of pharmacometrics in decision making
- speaker: Jee Eun Lee (USA)
- Parieotide - somatostatin analogue (high affinity for sstr5) -> somatostatin analogue (Novartis)
- 600ug BID failed to meet the pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint
- Flat E-R for efficacy / steep E-R for hyperglycemia
- Good for some - urine cortisol high patients 

#### Secukinumab
- Chronic Plaque Psoriasis
- Interindividual variability (PD, PK)
- Secukinumab (Cosentyx) - target population
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secukinumab (Novartis)
- Example of dose optimization
- Body weight - significant covariate - conc decreases with body weight (stratified by 90kg)
- Conc are higher in patients < 90kg
- 90kg 이상의 사람에게 150mg 추가 용량을 투여하는게 적합한가?
- IL-17(A) - Etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab(humira, shallow), ustekinumab = biologics
- IgA, 4 Phase III, (2 of them were pivotal study)
- PMC - post marketing commitment
- the higher conc. => the higher incidence of infections (tolerable)

#### Edoxaban (흥미로운 약물)
- NOAC - New Oral Anti-coagulants (4th)
- 1st rivaroxaban, 2nd dabigatran(issue-EMA), 3rd apixaban
- Ace Meeting?
- Normal - Mild - Moderate
- Exposure - response relationships (Efficacy-Stroke, safety-bleeding)
- Benefir-risk relationship is not novel. (Dabigatran: RE-LY trial)
- exposure-response relationship PK matching.
