**Summary**

- Unintended pregnancy and teen pregnancy continue to be important health problems in the United States. 
- Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is one strategy that has proven to be effective, yet underutilized. 

### Plenary 4
- speaker: Jay Ross Kaplan, Ph.D. Wake Forest School of Medicine

- Exogenous hormones (OCs) mitigate this effect.
- Estrogen treatment immediately following ovariectomy inhibits atheosclerosis; **delayed treatment ineffective** - perhaps because lesions are larger.
- CHD risk in pre- and early post-menopausal women - ELITE tiral and numerous re-examinations of existing trials.

### Plenary 5
- speaker: Jan Deprest, M.D., Ph.D., F.R.C.O.G. - University of Leuven
- Fetal surgery
- Obstetical endoscopy - TTTS 
- Angiogram showed "Third" circulation.
- "Chorangiopagus" - donor (oligohydramnios) recipient (polyhydramnios)
- Ultrasound screening programs can pick up congenital malformations, of which some are eligible for prenatal surgical repair. 
- **Some procedures are possible by fetoscopy**, while others require a hysterotomy. 
- impact of fetal surgery on the future reproductive life of the mother
- MOMS trial - 12mo outcomes (prenatal surgery, postnatal surgery) - uterine dehiscence (10%) !!!!
- Congenital diaphragmatic hernia - lethal pulmonary hypoplasia - fetoscopic surgery (tracheal occlusion)
    
**Future**

- Fetal surgery - fails in ~40% of cases -> Novel target discovery - gene expression analysis

### O-6 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF LOW (5%) VS. ULTRALOW (2%) OXYGEN TENSION FOR IN VITRO DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN EMBRYOS
- speaker: Daniel Kaser
- 5% - oviduct
- 2% - uterine
- How about culturing environment? 배양도 같은 방법으로 해야 하나?
- Design : 5% O2 (D1-D3) -> 5% vs 2% O2 (D4~ )
- Primary endpoint: Embryo stage and grade 
- Secondary endpoint: Spent media analyses
- These findings support our hypothesis that blastocyst yield and quality may be superior when O2 tension is reduced from 5% to 2% on day 3, thereby recapitulating the O2 environment in vivo.

### O-91 PREOVULATORY PROTEIN RESTRICTION (PPR): DISRUPTED AMINO ACID (AA) KINETICS AND MITOCHONDRIAL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION IN THE RAT OOCYTE
- speaker: Amy Schutt - Baylor College
- Maternal dietary intake critically supports the oocyte through maturation, fertilization and until embryo genome activation. 
- PPR -> profound changes in amino acid metabolism and COC mitochondrial structure and function in the rat. 
- Amino acid kinetics in the oocyte 
    - decreased ability to increase antioxidant precursor production
    - lack of effective compensation in the setting of protein starvation. 
- LP oocyte is vulnerable to oxidative stress as it cannot increase GSH production. 
    - **abnormal COC mitochondrial ultrastructure** and 
    - **altered oocyte expression of genes** related to mitochondrial biogenesis.

### O-92 EFFECTS OF RESVERATROL ON POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME
- speaker: Antoni Duleba (University of California, San Diego)
- Hyperandrogenism is the central feature of PCOS
- isolated ovarian theca-interstitial cells demonstrated that resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, inhibits mRNA expression of Cyp17a1 and reduces androgen production 
- evaluated endocrine and metabolic effects of resveratrol on women with PCOS.
- Prospective double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. 
    - clinical trial evaluating the effects of resveratrol on PCOS
- **Resveratrol significantly reduces serum levels of testosterone and DHEAS**
    - effect on ovarian as well as adrenal androgen production. 
    - **improvement of insulin sensitivity** and a decline of insulin level

### O-93 GENOME-WIDE DNA METHYLATION CHANGES IN MOUSE ZYGOTES ASSOCIATED WITH SUPEROVULATION 
- speaker: Bo Yu (University of Washington, Seattle)

    - to identify **DNA methylome changes** in pre-implantation mouse embryos after **ovarian hyperstimulation**

### O-94 CAN WE EXPECT TO IMPROVE AGE AT MENOPAUSE PREDICTIONS WITH REPEATED AMH MEASUREMENTS? 
- speaker: Annelien de Kat (University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands)
- high AMH -> late menopause, low AMH -> early menopause
- AMH decline rate
- Repeated measures of AMH levels
- Anti-M€ullerian hormone (AMH) levels are considered to be an **indicator of ovarian aging 
- unraveled **longitudinal decline trajectories of AMH with age**. 
- **1,857 women enrolled in the prospective, population-based Doetinchem Cohort Study, with a known age at natural menopause (ANM)**
- **picoAMH assay (AnshLabs) in a total of 7,666 plasma samples**
- Time to menopause 
    - modeled with the use of **mixed model analyses**, taking **non-linear** changes of AMH with age into account for each individual
- **longitudinal study** confirms the **overall association of AMH levels with time to menopause**, while taking into account individual AMH changes with time
